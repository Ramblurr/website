WordPress is a lamp application that is easy to host. There is a built-in export function, but be aware that this only includes the data, not the images. So importing a WordPress migration archive will only work if the old location is still online. An alternative way to migrate a WordPress site is to use a MySQL database dump, the .htaccess file, and the contents of the wp-content folder.

If you are approached by a customer who wants you to migrate a WordPress-based site, simply follow the [install instructions](https://wordpress.org/download/), import the database, and put the .htaccess file and wp-content folder in place. See also http://codex.wordpress.org/Moving_WordPress
