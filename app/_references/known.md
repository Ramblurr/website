title:       "Known"

Known is a lamp application that is easy to host. There is a built-in export function, but the corresponding import function is still being developed, so for migrations it's best to use a MySQL database dump, and the contents of the uploads folder.

If you are approached by a customer who wants you to migrate a Known-based site, simply follow the [install instructions](https://withknown.com/developers/), import the database, and put the uploads folder contents in place.
