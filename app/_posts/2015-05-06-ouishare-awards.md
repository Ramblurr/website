## Long time no see

Yes, it was quiet a while since the last post. But we are not sleeping, do not worry. In the mean time, some more people join the movement. We are now hosting around 80 people.
We are also working hard on how to offer a better infrastructure. For that reason, we'll head to Paris in May - for the [OuiShare Labs](http://camp.ouisharelabs.net/2015/).

## OuiShare Awards

We are delighted to tell you that we are nominated for the OuiShare Awards. Here is the video for the pitch:

(It was quiclky made over a weekend, faster than the crowdfunding video ;) )

## Bonus track

In March we were invited to participate to [FLOSS4P2P](http://www.p2pvalue.eu/floss4p2p-workshop-agenda), a great conference, with excellent speaker. We had a great time, and we even pitch IndieHosters!

You can find the video of the pitch bellow:
