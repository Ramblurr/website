## NLnet grant

We are very happy to announce we secured our first funding! We receive a grant from the awesome [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/) foundation,
which will help us to add two important products. First of all, we will add [Known](https://withknown.com/) as an alternative to WordPress.

Both Known and WordPress allow you to post on your own website, but whereas WordPress has a lot of plugins and the benefits of a huge global
user base, Known is more specialized in providing the latest technology from the [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) community out of the box. So these will be our first
two products, for you to choose from.

Apart from that, we will add [Piwik](https://piwik.org/) statistics, so you can always see how many people are visiting your internet domain,
on which days of the week you get the most visitors, and where they come from geographically. It's a fun way to get some feedback after you
publish a post, and get some insight into your popularity.

## Crowd-funding on Thursday!

And we have some more exciting news! Today, we recorded the video for the crowd-funding campaign. We will edit it to a short version, and put
the crowd-funding campaign live on Thursday 20 November. So make sure you stay tuned and are ready to start being hosted with us!
