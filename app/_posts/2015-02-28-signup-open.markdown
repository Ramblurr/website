## Signup is now open!

Two months have passed since the successful completion of our IndieGoGo
campaign, and everybody should have received their stickers and hosting
perks by now (if you didn't, please let us know).

As we found that some of you wanted to have a managed personal server
just for private use, not for making anything public to the world, we
added ownCloud as a fourth product (apart from Known, WordPress and
static webhosting).

Both Pierre and Michiel now offer managed personal server hosting of
those four products, for 8 euros / month.

Whereas Pierre specializes in hosting Known, WordPress, and ownCloud
(with piwik stats!), Michiel will also manage any other personal server
software for you at no extra cost, as long as it's technically doable.
So if you have any favorite personal server software which you would
like to try out (Sandstorm? Ethereum? Ghost? Cozy? Wallabag? GitLab?),
now you can!

Apart from that, we are preparing to offer a few services to all of you.
We worked hard to get on-the-fly activation of applications working,
meaning each customer can have as many applications as they want
'sleeping' on the server, and they only wake up when you use them. This
morning, Michiel just switched the first of his servers from haproxy to
Snickers ([technical info](https://github.com/michielbdejong/snickers)) to
prepare for this, and Pierre will soon also achieve the same effect,
using "socket activated docker" ([technical info](https://github.com/pierreozoux/indiepaas/issues/5)).

We believe migrations, and your freedom to move from one provider to
another, are a fundamental part of managed personal server hosting, and
of how you can own your little domain on the internet, without getting
locked in to any specific service provider. Let us give two examples of
how the IndieHosters migration network made a difference in its first
two months of operation.

As you know, IndieHosters offer migration for free. So for instance, if
you have a blog on 'yourname.withknown.com' or 'yourname.wordpress.com',
you can click export, come to us with the zip file, and we will make
sure your existing blogposts get ported to your own server (e.g.
yourname.com) when we set it up for you. In the case of Known, this is
actually a world-first, and we as the IndieHosters network were also
involved, contributing and helping the awesome Known team to get these
migrations working.

As another example, take [Trovebox.com](https://trovebox.com/) (previously known as OpenPhoto),
who are shutting down next month. In reaction, we started offering
Trovebox hosting. Hopefully all migrations will be complete before their
shutdown date of 15 March, and this can be a solution for the
Trovebox.com "site death". If this operation succeeds, then it would
also be a world-first, and hopefully we can do the same for many site
deaths to come, as internet startups that host our content keep shutting
down each month.

So you see, all the more reasons to support IndieHosters!  If you
didn't get a perk from the crowdfunding campaign, we have good news:
general signup is now open for you. For 8 euros per month, [get your own
managed internet server](https://indiehosters.net/index.html#claim).
