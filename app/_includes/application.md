You can choose which IndieHoster to buy this product from, or just pick the nearest one based on timezone and/or language. However, if at any point you are not happy with the service you are receiving from them, you can migrate to a different IndieHoster at any time, at no extra cost. You may also download all your data and start running your own server, or ask a friend or neighbor to start running your website for you, using [these setup instructions](/devops.html).

You may also bring your own data with you, if you are migrating from somewhere else.
