## Still not convinced?

We are doing it because it feels good to help and support [re-decentralize](http://redecentralize.org/) Internet! And we believe it's our duty for the following reasons:

Information is control, and the plan of the big companies (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) is to digitalize Humanity.

### Learning

You remember spending time on your myspace profile, and then, it was not trendy anymore, you had to learn facebook! We pick for you proven free software that are used by millions. Once you learn them, it is for your life!

### Migration

We believe that behing free to choose your personal server hoster is a greater freedom, and you shouldn't have to pay or worry about technical bits to migrate!
