## Hosting your own server is a hassle!
Many of us end up using Gmail and Facebook instead of a free software personal server stack.

## "Can't Someone Else Do It?"
Homer won a municipal election with [that slogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trash_of_the_Titans), why not us!

## Yes! We host your own server

And we do it for your freedom, not to become rich.
