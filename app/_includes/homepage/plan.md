## We'll host FOSS like nobody before did

### How do we compare to Gandi/OVH/1and1?

We don't ask users which domain name they want, because they probably don't know what it is. We rather ask them if they like `myname.com` and we buy it for them.
We don't ask if they want a TLS certificate to have https and increase their security, we generate one from startSSL in their name and install it on their server.

### How do we compare to wordpress.com?

We offer the same functionalities, for the same price, but for all free software, not just wordpress!

### How do we compare to GoogleApps/Facebook/Dropbox?

We care about your personal data, and will never sell them to third party services. That's why you are willing to pay us for this confidence! And if you don't like your hoster, just change it, like your personal trainer!

### How do we compare to CozyCloud?

We also plan to offer their software because it's great. We call this meta software as they  allow to manage other softwares. We plan to offer hosting for any kind of meta software.

### How do we compare to SandStorm?

Like cozy, it is a kind of meta software that is opinionated regarding the data that it hosts. We don't care about integration, we just host software. We believe that integration is another piece of software. And this piece of software will give freedom to the end user.

### What is our utopia?

Imagine a world where owncloud is offering remote-storage. Then you could pick a picture from wordpress though a plugin directly to your remote storage. And this is the greater freedom we are looking for. Whichever your hosting provider is, your softwares communicate between them because the standard is open. This is being libre! We believe that we can start the post silo era with this idea.
