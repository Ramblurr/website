# IndieHosters - Hosting for freedom, not for profit

## 1. Project plan

The project aims at building a network of Application Service Provider without profit. The first goal is to build tools for system administrator and DevOps to manage such a service. It will allow people with minimum knowledge in this area to start hosting Internet application for their community. The second goal is to develop this network. We believe that local small scale hosters is the way to fight against centralised Internet application provider (e.g. google). And we believe it is the right time to do it, for two reasons. Hardware is getting cheaper and cheaper. And automation tools start to be mature. It will allow us to build blazing simple tools, for powerful and resilient infrastructure.

### 1. the problem solved by this project

Let's say, there is a bug on Internet. For instance: gmail is spying private conversations. Software engineers have power to resolve bugs. They write a piece of software (mailpile for instance), and people will install them on their server, bug solved! But most of people online don't even know what a server is. So the idea is to write a little piece of software to host them all, and provide the service for the end user, in an easy way.

Not as any other silo, people will be free to move between indiehosters, or even start their own with their data. This is really important for us that people are free to change application service provider.

###  2. the relative advantage of the proposed innovation

If you compare us to:
- google: our advantage is that we don't aim at selling personal data.
- wordpress.com: our advantage is that we will be much cheaper.
- Yunohost/owncloud/cozycloud: our advantage is we can offer the 3 to end users.
- sandstorm.io: we will be more high availability

###  3. usability: for whom and to what purpose

We firstly target a geek (woman or man). She/He is probably working as software engineer and cares about free software and likes playing around/tinkering with computers. Or anybody that is concerned by privacy, and ready to  give up a bit of usabilty and money in exchange of freedom. This persons are concerned by their privacy and owning control over their data, but they don't have time to administer this softwares by themselves.

###  4. perspectives for further development of this innovation and/or other technologies

As more and more people are concerned by their privacy and ownership of data, we see more and more projects in this area trying to solve this issue. Most of them are software based, but without the service in mind. We see more and more people are interested. And so the ultimate goal is for every people have their freedom box at home. In the mean time, as it is still complicated for most of the people, we offer them to do it.

###  5. relevance for nlnet's mission

We believe writing software to make Internet a better place is nice. But it is worthless the effort if nobody is willing to host them. We offer to solve this challenge. Hosting Free and Open Source Software is the way to help people (not just geeks) escape mass surveillance, and getting back ownership over their data.

## 2. Existing work by others

The idea of a personal/cloud app store is not new. A lot of people already try to solve this challenge:
- freedom box
- yunohost
- cozy cloud
- sandstorm.io
- owncloud
- arkos

For now, just two of them offer hosting services as well (owncloud and sandstorm). The idea is to host them all, and offer the end user the choice for his app store (based on the existing list, and future software)


## 3. Existing work by us

We are at early stage of the project, and you can follow progress on our [GitHub account](https://github.com/indiehosters/). We already have static sites, and an instance of yunohost working. This allows us to provide emails and jabber for our end users.

## 4. Project setup

The project will be entirely funded by donations and its goals are entirely non-profit. We aim to research, publish and educate. We publish everything under AGPL for software, and Creative Commons licenses for everything else. The project will employ Michiel de Jong and Pierre Ozoux as full-time free-lance contractor. 

Much of the expertise Michiel brings to the project, was built up as founder at unhosted. http://www.linkedin.com/in/michielbdejong

Pierre works since 2 years as DevOps and software engineer for Seedrs. During this time, he contributed to some automation tools like Chef or Packer. http://www.linkedin.com/in/pierreozoux

## 5. Project planning

We decided to quit our current position to start this project fulltime on the first of October. We are now on our alpha phase with less than 10 users. We aim at reaching beta for 1st of january, the end of our crowdfunding campaign. Here is our plaaning for the 2 next quarterly.

1st January 2015: enter beta phase. We are able to provide the following services to the end user:
- emails
- jabber
- static html
- remoteStorage
- cozycloud
- yunohost
- owncloud
- wordpress
- backup personal data
- switch from one hoster to another one
During the beta phase, most of the services are not yet automatic, but everything is working, even if it is by hand.

1st April 2015: enter stable phase. We are able to provide this set of services, in an automatic way. And they are all stables. We might have more services in beta mode. But we focus on providing a small set in stable first.

## 6. Project budgeting

There is not much expenses besides the salary of the 2 founders. So the budget goes as following for the first 6 months:
The budget is 6x3000 = 18000 euros. This includes:

* 2000 euros/month net 'salary' - 2 people
* 300 euros/month German/Portuguese health insurance - 2 people
* 300 euros/month desk in a flex-office - 2 people
* 200 euros/month reserved for taxes and other administrative costs like registry and bank fees - 2 people
* 200 euros/month reserved for demo hosting, conference attendance, and miscellaneous costs - 2 people

We will also run a crowdfunding campaign on November, and we hope this will bring us enough to finance the rest of the year.
